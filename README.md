# money-after-expenses

This is my first Python project outside of the guided projects in Codecademy's Learn Python 3 course.
With this program, a user can input their general financial information, and the program will calculate how much money the user has left after monthly expenses.
Please keep in mind that the program does not take into account income tax.

This program is free to use and distribute.
